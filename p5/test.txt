According to [Bjarne] Stroustrup: "the name signifies the evolutionary 
nature of the changes from C". This name is credited to Rick Mascitti 
(mid-1983) and was first used in December 1983.

When Mascitti was questioned informally in 1992 about the naming, he 
indicated that it was given in a tongue-in-cheek spirit. The name stems 
from C's "++" operator (which increments the value of a variable) and a 
common naming convention of using "+" to indicate an enhanced computer 
program. A joke goes that the name itself has a bug: due to the use of 
post-increment, which increments the value of the variable but evaluates 
to the unincremented value, C++ is no better than C, and the pre-increment 
++C form should have been used instead.

During C++'s development period, the language had been referred to as 
"new C", then "C with Classes", before acquiring its final name.
