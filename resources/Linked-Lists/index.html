<h2>Intro to Linked Lists</h2>
</a>
<p>
Here's a conceptual picture of a linked list containing N items,
pointed to by a variable named  <span class="Java">head</span>:</p>
<p>
<pre>
      +--+     +-----+--+     +-----+--+     +-----+--+              +-----+-+
head: | -|---> |item1| -|---> |item2| -|---> |item3| -|---> ... ---> |itemN|\|
      +--+     +-----+--+     +-----+--+     +-----+--+              +-----+-+
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Note that a linked list consists of one or more <span class="term">nodes</span>.
Each node contains some data (in this example, item 1, item 2,
etc.) and a pointer (note: usually the data is technically a pointer as well).
For each node other than the last one, the pointer points to the next
node in the list.
For the last node, the pointer is null (indicated in the example using
a diagonal line).

To implement linked lists in C++, we will define a <span class="Java">ListNode</span>
struct, to be used to represent the individual nodes of the list.</p>

<a name="listnode"></a>
<dir><pre>
struct ListNode {
    void *data;
    Listnode *next;
};
</pre></dir>
<p>Note that the <span class="Java">void *</span> type for the <span class="Java">data</span> field allows
<span class="Java">data</span> to point to any type (for this reason the <span class="term">void pointer</span>
is also known as a <span class="term">generic pointer</span>).
In order to dereference <span class="Java">data</span>, a cast must be done to the actual type of the object 
<span class="Java">data</span> is pointing at, e.g.,
<span class="Java">int *dataPtr = static_cast&lt;int*&gt;(node.data);</span> casts the void pointer to an <span class="Java">int</span> pointer which can
then be dereferenced as usual using <span class="Java">*</span>

Note also that the <span class="Java">next</span> field of a <span class="Java">ListNode</span> is itself of type
<span class="Java">ListNode</span>.
</p>
<p>
To understand this better, consider writing code to create a linked
list of <span class="Java">string</span>s with two nodes, containing <span class="Java">"ant"</span> and <span class="Java">"bat"</span>, respectively, pointed
to by a variable named <span class="Java">head</span> (the pointer to the first node in a linked list is often called a
<span class="term">head pointer</span>).
First we need to declare variable <span class="Java">head</span> and
make <span class="Java">head</span> point to the first node of the list.
We'll use <span class="Java">new</span> to
allocate space for that node.
We want its <span class="Java">data</span> field to contain <span class="Java">"ant"</span> and we'll
set the <span class="Java">next</span> field to <span class="Java">NULL</span>):</p>
<p>Here's the code together with a picture showing what we have so far:</p>
<p>
<pre>
ListNode *head = new ListNode;
head->data = "ant";
head->next = NULL;

      +--+     +-----+-+
head: | -|---> |"ant"|\|
      +--+     +-----+-+
</pre>
</p>
<p>
To add the second node to the end of the list we need to create the
new node (with <span class="Java">"bat"</span> in its <span class="Java">data</span> field and null in its
<span class="Java">next</span> field) and we need to set the <span class="Java">next</span> field of
the first node to point to the new one:</p>
<p>
<pre>
ListNode *tmp = new ListNode;
tmp->data = "bat";
tmp->next = NULL;
head->next = tmp;

      +--+     +-----+--+     +-----+-+
head: | -|---> |"ant"| -|---> |"bat"|\|
      +--+     +-----+--+     +-----+-+
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Linked List Operations</h2></a>
<p>
Let's consider some basic operations on linked lists:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Adding a node to the list.</li>
  <li> Removing a given node from the list.</li>
</ul>

<p>When we add a node to the list, how we do it may depend on where the node is being added.  We will consider adding a node:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to the beginning of a list,</li>
  <li>after a given node in the list, and</li>
  <li>to the end of a list</li>
</ul>

<a name="addBegin"></a>
<h3>Adding to the beginning of a list</h3>
<p>Assume that <span class="Java">head</span> is a pointer to the first node in the list and that <span class="Java">newdat</span> is
This means that the new node will become the new first node in the list and that what had been the first node will now need to
be pointer to by the new node's <span class="Java">next</span> field.  Here's the code:</p>
<p><pre>
ListNode *tmp = new ListNode;
tmp->data = newdat;
tmp->next = head;     // tmp's next will point to what had been the first node
head = tmp;           // update head pointer
</pre></p>
<p>Note that this works even if the list is initially empty: if the list is empty, then<span class="Java">head</span>
is null, so the <span class="Java">next</span> field of the new node will be set to null.
</p>


<a name="addMiddle"</a>
<h3>Adding after a given node in a list</h3>
<p>
Assume that we are given:</p>
<ol>
  <li> <span class="Java">n</span>, (a pointer to) a node in a list (i.e., <span class="Java">n</span> is
       a <span class="Java">Listnode</span>), and</li>
  <li> <span class="Java">newdat</span>, the data to be stored in a new node</li>
</ol>
<p>
and that the goal is to add a new node containing <span class="Java">newdat</span> immediately
after <span class="Java">n</span>.  To do this we must perform the following steps:</p>
<dir>Step 1: create the new node using the given data<br><br>

Step 2: "link it in":
  <ol type="a">
    <li>make the new node's <span class="Java">next</span> field point to whatever
     <span class="Java">n</span>'s <span class="Java">next</span> field was pointing to</li>
  <li>make <span class="Java">n</span>'s <span class="Java">next</span> field point to the new node.</li>
  </ol>
</dir>
<p>
Here's the conceptual picture (note: in the images below, we really should use <span class="Java">head</span> instead of <span class="Java">l</span>):</p>
<p>
<img src="addnode.gif"></p>
<p>(note: n.next in step 2(b) should be n->next)
<p>
And here's the code:<a name="addNodeCode"></a>
<dir><pre>
ListNode *tmp = new Listnode;
tmp->data = newdat;                       // Step 1
tmp->next = n->next;                      // Step 2(a)
n->next = tmp;                            // Step 2(b)
</pre></dir>
<p>
Note that it is vital to first copy the value of <span class="Java">n</span>'s
<span class="Java">next</span> field
into <span class="Java">tmp</span>'s <span class="Java">next</span> field (step 2(a)) before setting
<span class="Java">n</span>'s <span class="Java">next</span> field to point to the new node (step 2(b)).
If we set <span class="Java">n</span>'s <span class="Java">next</span> field first, we would lose our
only pointer to the rest of the list after node <span class="Java">n</span>!</p>
<p>
Also note that, in order to follow the steps shown in the picture
above, we needed to use variable <span class="Java">tmp</span> to create the new node
(in the picture, step 1 shows the new node just "floating" there, but
that isn't possible -- we need to have some variable point to it so
that we can set its <span class="Java">next</span> field and so that we can set
<span class="Java">n</span>'s <span class="Java">next</span> field to point to it).
</p>


  
<a name="removeNode">
<h3>Removing a node</h3></a>
<p>
To remove a given node <span class="Java">n</span> from a linked list, we need to
change the <span class="Java">next</span> field of the node that comes immediately
<em>before</em> <span class="Java">n</span> in the list to point to whatever <span class="Java">n</span>'s
<span class="Java">next</span> field was pointing to.

Here's the conceptual picture (note: as before, in the images below, we really should use <span class="Java">head</span> instead of <span class="Java">l</span>):</p>
<p>
<img src="removenode.gif"></p>
<p>
Note that we will also need to delete the node <span class="Java">n</span> is pointing to (to avoid a memory leak).

It should be clear that in order to implement the <span class="adt">remove</span> operation, we
first need to have a pointer to the node <em>before</em> node <span class="Java">n</span>
(because that node's <span class="Java">next</span> field has to be changed).
The only way to get to that node is to start at the beginning of the
list.
We want to keep moving along the list as long as the current node's
<span class="Java">next</span> field is <em>not</em> pointing to node <span class="Java">n</span>.
Here's the appropriate code:</p>
<dir><pre>
ListNode *tmp = head;
while (tmp->next != n) {  // find the node before n
    tmp = tmp->next;    
}</pre></dir>
<p>
Note that this kind of code (moving along a list until some condition holds)
is very common.
For example, similar code would be used to implement a <span class="adt">lookup</span>
operation on a linked list (an operation that determines whether there
is a node in the list that contains a given piece of data).</p>
<p>
Note also that there is one case when the code given above will not
work.
When <span class="Java">n</span> is the very first node in the list, the picture is
like this:</p>
<p>
<img src="firstnode.gif"></p>
<p>
In this case, the test <span class="Java">(tmp->next != n)</span> will always be false and
eventually we will "fall off the end" of the list (i.e., <span class="Java">tmp</span> will
become null and we will get a runtime error when we try to dereference
a null pointer).
We will take care of that case in a minute;
first, assuming that <span class="Java">n</span> is not the first node in the list, here's the
code that removes <span class="Java">n</span> from the list:</p>
<dir>
<pre>
ListNode *tmp = head;
while (tmp->next != n) {  // find the node before n
    tmp = tmp->next;       
}
tmp->next = n->next;      // remove n from the linked list
delete n;                 // free the memory pointed to by n
</pre>
</dir>

<p>
How can we test whether <span class="Java">n</span> is the first node in the list and
what should we do in that case?
If <span class="Java">n</span> is the first node, then <span class="Java">head</span> will be pointing to it,
so we can test whether <span class="Java">head == n</span>.
The following before and after pictures illustrate removing node <span class="Java">n</span>
when it is the first node in the list:</p>
<p>
<img src="removeFirst.gif">
<p><a name="removeNodeCode">
Here's the complete code for removing node <span class="Java">n</span> from a linked list,
including the special case when <span class="Java">n</span> is the first node in the list:</a>
<dir><pre>
if (head == n) {
  // special case: n is the first node in the list
    head = n->next;
} else {
  // general case: find the node before n, then "unlink" n
    ListNode *tmp = head;
    while (tmp->next != n) {  // find the node before n
        tmp = tmp->next;       
    }
    tmp->next = n->next;      // remove n from the linked list
}
delete n;                     // free the memory pointed to by n
</pre></dir>


<a name="addEnd"></a>
<h3>Adding to the end of a list</h3>
<p>Finally, we look at how best to handle adding a new node at the end
of the list.
A straightforward approach would be to traverse the list, looking for
the last node (i.e., use a variable <span class="Java">tmp</span> as was done above
in the code that looked for the node before node <span class="Java">n</span>).
Once the last node is found, the new node can be inserted immediately after it.</p>

<p>
An alternative (which does not require a traversal of the entire linked list)
is to keep track of a <span class="term">tail pointer</span> (i.e., a pointer to
the last node in the list) in addition to a head pointer.  Note that this will require
that operations that modify a linked list need to make sure that the tail pointer
is kept up to date so it always points to the last node in the list.
There is more opportunity for error (since there are potentially several operations/pieces of code
that will need to keep the tail pointer up to data), but the
use of the tail pointer will mean that adding to the end of a list can be done very quickly, regardless
of the number of nodes in the list (which will be
important for applications that frequently add to the end of a list).
</p>
<p>
Here's a picture of the "ant, bat, cat" list, when
the implementation includes a <span class="Java">tail</span> pointer: </p>
<p>
<pre>
      +--+     +-----+--+     +-----+--+     +-----+-+
head: | -|---> |"ant"| -|---> |"bat"| -|---> |"cat"|\|
      +--+     +-----+--+     +-----+--+     +-----+-+    
                                                ^
      +--+                                      |
