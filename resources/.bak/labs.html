<h2 id="Accounts">CS Computer Account:</h2>

    <p><b>A CS account is automatically issued to you by the Computer Systems Lab (CSL) after you
    register for the course.</b> This account provides you with access to the <a href="#Locations">lab
    computers</a>, a disk quota (for file storage), and paper quota (for printing). Only registered
    students are given an account. See the
    <a href="https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/services/user-accounts/about-your-instructional-account" target="_page">"About Your Instructional Account"</a>
    page for more information about your cs accout. To use this account you <i>may</i>
    need to activate it:

    <ul>
      <li><p>You <em>do not</em> need to re-activate your account if you are a declared CS major or had an account
          during the past semester.
          Login using the same CS username and password from the past semester.</p></li>
      <li>You <em>do</em> need to activate your account if you are a new user of the CS lab computers.
          Use any web browser to visit <a href="https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/account_management/netid_login_message" target="_page">https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/account_management/netid_login_message</a>. You will need to authenticate to the UW-Madison NetID Login
    Service. If you are not already authenticated via NetID, you will be
    redirected to the NetID Login page when you continue to the account
    activation page.
<p>You can also activate your account in the instructional Linux lab: 
 login on any Linux instructional workstations as the user "accthelp"
    (no password required). This will launch a browser at the account
    activation web site.</p>
          <p>Note there may be up to a 24 hour delay from the time you register until the time you may activate
          your CS account.</p></li>
    </ul>

<p><b><em>If you have forgotten your username or password</em></b>, use any web browser to visit 
<a href="https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/account_management/netid_login_message" target="_page">https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/account_management/netid_login_message</a> or
login on any CS Linux instructional workstation as the user "accthelp"
    (no password required)
</p>
    <p>If you have problems with your account go to the Computer Systems Lab (CSL),
    room 2350 CS, during regular business hours (Monday through Friday from 8 am - noon, 1 
    pm - 5 pm).
    Make sure to bring your UW student id.</p>

<h2 id="Locations">CS Computer Labs:</h2>


    <p>The computer labs for use by students are located on the <em>first floor of the
    Computer Sciences</em> building during the hours <em>from 7 am - 1 am every
    day</em>.</p>

    <p>For locations look for the <em>Linux machines</em> listed in the
    <a href="https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/services/instructional-facilities" target="_page">"Computer
    Systems Lab Instructional Facilities"</a> page.</p>

<h3 id="RemoteAccess">Remote Access:</h3>
<dir>
    <p>You may also remotely log into these machines. To access the machines remotely, connect to
     <em><tt>best-linux.cs.wisc.edu</tt></em> (this will connect you to the linux machine in the 
     CS labs that currently has the fewest number of other users logged in to it).  If your computer gives you a warning about spoofing, try connecting to
	 <em><tt>best-galapagos.cs.wisc.edu</tt></em> (and if neither of those work, try connecting to <tt>galapagos-<i>NN</i>.cs.wisc.edu</tt> where <tt><i>NN</i></tt> is a 2 digit number between 01 and 30). 
    </p>

    <p>See the
    <a href="https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/services/remote-access-csl-computers" target="_page">"Remote Access to CSL Computers"</a>
    page for more information about remote access.</p>

<h2 id="Printing">Printing:</h2>

    <p>All the instructional machines are set up to print to the printers in <em>1359 CS</em>.</p>

    <h3>Basic instructions for printing
    from the instructional machines:</h3>
<dir>
    <p>In order to print from any of the computers
    your paper quota must be greater than 0. At the beginning of the semester all CS
    students receive an initial paper quota established by the CSL. If you exhaust your
    paper quota you must go to the CSL in 2350 CS during workday hours to purchase more
    pages.</p>

    <p>Each of your print jobs will
    be scheduled individually and may print out on any of the printers in 1359
    CS. To check which printer your job is coming out on look for your login
    name on the monitor by each printer.</p>

    <p>If there is a problem with
    one of the printers or there is no paper left in the print room send email to <tt>lab@cs.wisc.edu</tt>. 
    <em>Do not try to fix any of the printers
    yourself</em>.</p>

    <p>For further information
    about printing (how to check your quota, how to remove a job that you printed
    accidentally, etc.) check the
    <a href="https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/services/printing" target="_page">"Printing and Printers"</a> page.</p>
